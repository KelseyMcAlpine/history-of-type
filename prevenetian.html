                    <h2>Pre-Venetian typography was inspired by historical forms from before the 15th century. Two different styles included in Pre-Venetian typography are Incised and Blackletter. Incised letterforms are modeled after letters that were carved in stone. Blackletter typography is characterized as a script style of calligraphy made with a broad-nibbed pen. Blackletter is highly ornamental and its typefaces make use vertical, curved, and angled strokes. It was popular from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance throughout Europe. In Germany, however, it was popular through the 20th Century.</h2>

                    Fraktur, characterized by broken strokes, is the most common form of Blackletter. For a span of nearly a hundred years, the original Fraktur script was used as a standard typeface in Germany and parts of Scandinavia. Today, Fette Fraktur is one of the most frequently used Fraktur fonts. It is used to invoke a sense of nostalgia and communicate a sense of tradition. It also evokes a sense of traditional Austrian, Bavarian, or German &ldquo;flavor.&rdquo; The lower case letters have a Gothic character with only the ornamental flourishes making them broken letters, while the capital letters are more characteristic of broken letter typefaces</p>
