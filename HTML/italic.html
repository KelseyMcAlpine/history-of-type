                        Although Italic forms were originally designed in Italy in 1500 (or possibly even earlier), the first notable use of the Italic was in an edition of the book Virgil (the &ldquo;Aldine Virgil&rdquo;), which was created in 1501 by Francesco Griffo. At the time, Griffo was a typecutter to Aldus Manutius, a printer in Venice. Griffo modeled the italic forms on handwritten, calligraphic letters used in the papal chanceries of the time. It is characterized by its slant to the right and its modulated stroke. The Italic forms were considered revolutionary because they were condensed and therefore space saving.

                    Blado Italic was designed to accompany the typeface Poliphilus. Although Francesco Griffo cut the roman typeface which Poliphilus was based on, he did not create Blado Italic. Rather, the design for Blado Italic was based on a design by calligrapher Ludovico degli Arrighi. Arrighi died shortly after finishing the typeface, and the typeface was later acquired by the master printer Antonio Blado. Monotype chose to name the typeface after Blado, the printer who used the typeface rather than the calligrapher who designed it.Blado Italic was designed to accompany the typeface Poliphilus.
