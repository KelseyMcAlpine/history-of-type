                        The Sans Serif category includes the widest range of subgroups. They are called &ldquo;Sans Serifs&rdquo; because sans means without&mdash;so they all do not have serifs.  The first sans serif typeface appeared in the early 1800s. Sans Serifs were literally called &ldquo;grotesque&rdquo; for their shocking appearance. The early grotesques were essentially ignored at the time because of the popularity of Didones and Slab Serifs.  However, Modernism in the 1920s brought Sans Serif types into greater use. Modernists favored the simplicity that Sans Serif typefaces offer. They continue to be widely used and are can be used for both headlines and body text.

                    Univers was released in 1957 by the Deberny & Peignot foundry in Paris. Adrian Frutiger began creating the Univers typeface while he was still a student in Zurich. Univers is a Noe-Grotesque sans serif, similar to its contemporary, Helvetica. The full Univers family consists of twenty-one typefaces of different weights and measures which are all designed to work with one another. With Univers, Frutiger was the first to introduce a numbering system to categorize these weights and measures, which was later also adopted by Linotype.  Because of its many weights and measures, Univers is appropriate for a wide range of uses.
