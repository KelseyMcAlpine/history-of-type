                    <h2>
                        During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, the typography and printing industry boomed. Slabs serifs were developed in the 19th century out of commercial necessity and demand for bigger and bolder typefaces.  Simply making preexisting typefaces (which were used almost exclusively as body copy) bolder resulted in less legibility, so two forms of Slab Serifs were developed. The earlier unbracketed version known as Egyptians and the later bracketed version known as Clarendons. Slab serifs have serifs that are equal to or nearly the same thickness of the main strokes. Typically, slab serifs have minimal or no bracketing.

                    Soho was published by Monotype out of the U.K. in 2007.  Soho was created by typeface designer Sebastian Lester, whose goal was to make a font that &ldquo;looked very 21st century.&rdquo; Lester also noticed that the number of multi-weight slab serif designs were few and far between, and aimed at creating a full stylistic set. Soho features many different weights and measures, which is great for a designer to work with. The Soho suite offers a lightweight, condensed, super-strong and heavy version.
